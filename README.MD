This plugin for [Indigo](https://www.indigodomo.com/) extends the Indigo Home Automation system with an
interface to the Dutch Smart Meters which comply to DSMR (Dutch Smart Meter
Requirements). The smart meter P1 interface must be connected to Indigo via a
serial to usb cable. The plugin will parse both electricity and gas usage.
This information is stored in an Indigo device and can be used from there. You can show it on a GUI or e.g.
write smart decisions to max power usage only when the low tariff is valid.

The plugin can be found in the [Indigo plugin store](https://www.indigodomo.com/pluginstore/).
Full documentation of this plugin can be found
on [my website](https://www.zengers.net/indigo/p1-meter-plugin/).
